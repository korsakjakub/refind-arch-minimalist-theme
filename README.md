# refind-arch-minimalist-theme
This is a very minimal theme for rEFInd with a white Archlinux icon and black background. 
Matches black MacOS bootloader pretty well.

# Installation

1. Create directory `themes` in `/boot/EFI/BOOT` and copy this folder inside.
2. Edit `refind.conf` to include the relative path (eg. `include themes/refine-arch-minimalist-theme/theme.conf`
3. Reboot and hope for the best.
